# rust-websocket-bench
Distributed load testing for rust websocket

RUST is a fast, safe and efficient programming language to develope
highly concurrent and parallel programs. So I believe to acheive something like this blog - [erlang-phoenix 2 million websocket connection.]( http://phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections).

1. Prerequisites for build

    Install Rust by run the following in your terminal

    ```bash
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```
    or follow [this official installation instruction](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).
